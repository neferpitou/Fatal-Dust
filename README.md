Fatal Dust
====

Fatal Dust is a 2D fantasy fighting game which takes inspiration from classic fighting games such as Street Fighter, King of Fighters, and Eternal Champions, but also features some fantasy elements. It is written purely in Java and uses the Swing API as well as some new tools provided by the Java 8 API such as lambda expressions and functional interfaces. Therefore, this project will not run unless Java 8 is installed on the host computer.

This game uses copyrighted artwork and was created purely for educational purposes. We have no plans to sell this game as-is.

If you want to download and run the game, it is suggested to use the Eclipse IDE to import the project. This project was developed using exclusively the Eclipse IDE and is the only one that we can vouch for 100% success with. Other IDEs may work but your mileage may vary.
